# Plots with ggplot2

We are going to make plots in R and it's going to be amazing.

I will now check out reprex

```{r}
# Load packages
library(reprex)
library(skimr)
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
# Load packages
library(tidyverse)
# Practicing a reprex and Issues. 
# Allison_horst how do I change the point color to cyan?
# Make graph for reprex
ggplot(cars, aes(speed, dist)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r}
# filter the mtcars dataset
library(tidyverse)
# Filter to mpg more than 26
mtcars %>% filter(mpg > 26)

```
